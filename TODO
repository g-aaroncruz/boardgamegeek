#1) No sample code
#2) Tests need to be automated or have hooks for begginers.
#3) Getting started needs better handling since many dependancies are missing. relies on 'setuptools' 'pip', 'mock', 'pytest'
#4) running 'main.py' doesn't work because of pathing. Need to doublecheck, because once I installed package it works... but should work without installation.
#5) python3 boardgamegeek/main.py -c wanttoplay -u <user> - fails on query...
