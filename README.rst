Development status: **unmaintained**


    To everybody sending PRs and issues: thank you for the interest in the project! Unfortunately, as it can be seen from my lack of interaction with you, I don't have the time     or energy to work on it anymore. I don't exclude coming back at some point but as of now it's pretty unlikely. Sorry. If anyone of you would like to continue, 
    feel free to fork.



``boardgamegeek`` is a Python library which makes it easy to access data from BoardGameGeek_ using their official XML
API.

It's an almost completely rewritten fork of libBGG_.
